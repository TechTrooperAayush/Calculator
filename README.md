# Calculator

The Calculator project is a web application that simulates a basic calculator functionality. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Main Features

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
Users can perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The calculator displays the result of each operation in real-time.

### Clear Button
The "C" button clears the display, allowing users to start a new calculation.

### Error Handling
The calculator includes error handling to gracefully handle invalid input or calculations that result in errors (e.g., division by zero).

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the buttons to input numbers and perform arithmetic operations.
3. Click the "C" button to clear the display and start a new calculation.
